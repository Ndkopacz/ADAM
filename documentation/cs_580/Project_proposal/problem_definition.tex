\section{Problem Definition}
ADAM (Autonomous Deterrent and Alert Module) is a project focused on building a threat detection system using a Raspberry Pi equipped with a camera and a machine learning model.
 The system is designed to identify specific threats—in this case, detecting a person wearing a red hat—and trigger a deterrent, such as a buzzer and flashing LED.
The aim is to train a machine learning model that is both efficient enough to run on a Raspberry Pi and robust enough to handle real-world situations, like noisy data. 
Additionally, the model must be interpretable so that we can understand and trust how it makes its decisions.

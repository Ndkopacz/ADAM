\section{Problem Definition}
This project aims to develop and assess a computer vision model with techniques focused on trustworthiness and interpretability.
ADAM (Autonomous Deterrent and Alert Module) is a project focused on building a threat detection system using a Raspberry Pi equipped with a camera and a machine learning model.
 The system is designed to identify specific threats—for example, detecting a person wearing a red hat—and trigger a deterrent, such as a buzzer and flashing LED.
The aim is to train a machine learning model that is both efficient enough to run on a Raspberry Pi and robust enough to handle real-world situations, like noisy data. 
Trusting a model with the ability to trigger a deterrent heightens the importance of the model's trustworthiness.
Additionally, the model must be interpretable so that we can understand and trust how it makes its decisions.
Such interpretations can help identify bugs and biases.
ADAM is a image based classification model that will be fine tuned with few shot learning, interpreted with LIME, and assessed with adversarial attacks.

\section{Related Work}
Machine learning-based object detection is commonly used in surveillance systems.
Models like YOLO (You Only Look Once) are optimized for real-time performance and are frequently used in applications requiring fast and accurate object detection. 
Such models, when combined with transfer learning, are well-suited for adapting to new tasks like detecting a red hat in this case. 
While performance is crucial, interpretability and robustness have become increasingly important in real-world AI deployments. 
Techniques like LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) allow developers to understand how models make decisions, while robustness testing ensures that models are reliable under diverse conditions, such as when data is noisy or incomplete.

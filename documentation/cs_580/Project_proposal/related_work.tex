\section{Related Work}
Machine learning-based object detection is commonly used in surveillance systems.
Models like YOLO (You Only Look Once) are optimized for real-time performance and are frequently used in applications requiring fast and accurate object detection. 
Alternatively, Inception models are known for high accuracy and efficient memory usage with scale, which is useful given hardware constraints in a raspberry pi.
Such models, when combined with transfer learning, are well-suited for adapting to new tasks like detecting a red hat, for example. 
While performance is crucial, interpretability and robustness have become increasingly important in real-world AI deployments. 
Techniques like LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) allow developers to understand how models make decisions, while robustness testing ensures that models are reliable under diverse conditions, such as when data is noisy or incomplete.
In order to give assurances on the robustness of a system, models are often tested against adversarial datasets, which can be generated to target the case-specific data.
